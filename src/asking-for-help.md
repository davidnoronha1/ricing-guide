# How to RTFM & Get help

> [!NOTE]
> TLDR: Read documentation before asking questions and if you don't find / can't think of an answer, put effort into asking questions and ask questions in places where they are most likely to answered.

Read manuals whenever you can, those can be easily accessed for any installed software by doing `man <NAME-OF-SOFTWARE>`, or by searching through a online [repository](https://manpages.debian.org/).
If manpages are too long for you, You can also try using [tldr-pages](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr) to get the very basics of an application with some examples

Applications will list all their options there along with addition options specific to the application. Many apps also have GitHub wikis or documentation in the README for their app, kindly refer to those too.

If you're decent at googling - you can find most things you need to relatively easily with maybe a little help. If your question is a something like `can X do Y`, that is a question that should be solved by google and the application's documentation.

Dig deep into the dotfiles of other rices, if you have no idea how they did a thing. Most people are willing to explain how / why they did something in such a way, Which is a great way to learn and understand things.

#### Do not expect a guide / tutorial
I put this here because I see questions like "How do I rice?" or "Is there a tutorial for it?" way more often than I'd like.

Barely any linux software is documented in such a through manner to have documentation like that.
Most of the software isn't trying to hold your hand. Most of it is to fill a need for the developer himself and which he has kindly shared with the community.
Whether you like it or not to rice effectively, you will need to learn the ins and outs of any apps you use and generally you'll need some programming knowledge too. Just being good at programming isn't all you need, You need to have a good eye and have some knowledge of user interface design or just know *what looks good*.
There is a good reason there are not that many good rices, it's a difficult thing to do.

If you can't do that, maybe ricing isn't for you. No harm just using a desktop environment.

#### Getting help

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Found a nice article on the topic, read it!:  http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html .==

> [!IMPORTANT]
> SO has a guide on how to ask questions that applies to a lot of other places, https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask==

Ask for help in a community related to that one piece of software you want help for. Usually there is at least a GitHub discussion, an IRC chat room or a Matrix space / discord server for most things.
Make good use of them, you'll meet developers of the software and actual users of the software there. Instead of asking in something like the UP server which is only mildly related to that software.

Be nice, and diplomatic,
All of the people helping you are volunteering and spending their time and effort to help you solve your problem. Even if their solution isn't exactly what you wanted, it could still point out the right way to a solution.
Explore properly and don't criticize anyone for giving an answer that did not solve your problem.

See the following: [Don't ask to ask.](https://dontasktoask.com/) & [The X / Y Problem](https://xyproblem.info/)

Stick to the correct channels and follow rules.
If you spam your question in multiple channels, that simply draws ire from the members of the community and doesn't increase the chances of your question being solved.
Do not think you are being ignored if your question isn't answered in a reasonable amount of time (usually a day or 2, other people have lives too, you know).
It's either that no one knows the solution to your problem or no one cares enough to answer it (in which case, write your question out with more effort, and try to see if it has been solved in the documentation or elsewhere already).
Write out your question in overwhelming detail - mention everything you have already tried and what you have found related to your problem.
Upload your configuration files somewhere (like [0x0.st](https://0x0.st) or [paste.rs](https://paste.rs)) and link them in your question, share screenshots of what your problem is.
Try explaining it in simple language.
