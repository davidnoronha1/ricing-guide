<h1>ü•ü A Ricing Roadmap</h1>
</header>
<br/>
There is a lot of choice when you start ricing and there are so many things you can dive into that it can easily become overwhelming, So this is a kind of road map I wrote of what things you should do in what order to really understand if you like ricing. <br/>
<br/>
<b>DISCLAIMER</b>:  There are many different ways to go about ricing, After all ricing is about creative expression and even more about making your desktop comfortable for yourself. There are a million different things you can change and add to make it more personal.<br/>
<br/>
Let's begin:<br/>
<br/>
 From the perspective of someone who has recently installed a common distribution and has seen one of the posts on unixporn and wants to also make his desktop look like it.<br/>
<br/>
To have some kind of idea of what our final product will be, Let us aim for something similar to this (w/ the same stuff, style will be different ofc)<br/>

<ul>
<li>Ricing terminology <a href="./terminology">[LEARN]</a><br/>

<li>Basic linux knowledge<br/>

<h2 id="##-üèÉ Escaping The DE"> üèÉ Escaping The DE</h2>
<p>
First things first we have the ecosystem of the pre installed desktop environment to the safe lands of window managers.<br/>
<br/>
Why we do this is because DE's offer limited customization, they are designed to be a whole experience and as such you can't mold them to fit your own vision. Of course you can rice a DE, but it's a harder time. The advantages of using a standalone window manager are numerous but for ricing the main reasons are ease of modification and productivity.<br/>
<br/>
Window Managers are generally divided into 2 main types, those are tiling and stacking (floating) window managers. <br/>
<br/>
Most of what you'll be used it stacking window managers which were popularized by Windows and the Macintosh (I think). This is where windows can overlap each other like so:<br/>
<br/>
<div class="floating-demo">A window</div><br/>
But a tiling window manager is different, Generally your screen is organized into a grid like pattern and each window <b>can only</b> occupy the allotted space, Like so:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<table class="tiling-demo">
<tr>
	<td rowspan="2">Window 1</td>
	<td>Window 2</td>	
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Window 3</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br/>
If you like you can think of it as enforcing window snapping for every window with no way to remove a window from its snapped state, you can only move it around.<br/>
This offers many benefits which I am not going to get into now. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/5zl0tv/why_use_a_tiling_window_manager_over_a_floating/">[reddit post about it]</a><br/>
<br/>
By virtue of not being a entire DE and just focusing on managing your windows, They don't perform many of the functions you would be used to in a DE, things like launching apps, widgets, notifications, a dashboard etc must all be implemented by yourself which is where the flexibility of using a WM lies.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I am oversimplifing a lot of things here.</i><br/>
<br/>
I would recommend Bspwm (tiling), Openbox (floating) & i3 (tiling+floating) since although being beginner friendly they can be flexible enough to fit most desires, Besides many people are familiar with them and there exist lots of resources for them.<br/>
<br/>
Switching to a WM is as simple as installing the necessary package, hopefully this is as simple as <code># $PKGMANAGER install $WM</code> but if not you'll need to compile the wm from source code, Instructions for doing so should be available in either a COMPILE.md or INSTALL or such.<br/>
<br/>
If you choose i3 or bspwm, You will need to take some time to become familiar with the method of navigating windows by way of keyboard shortcuts and with the tiling layout in general, I'd suggest you take the time to get used to it before continuing on.<br/>
<br/>
* bspwm in particular requires a fair amount of pre requisite knowledge in sh scripting and such. You need sxhkd for defining key bindings.<br/>

<h3 id="###-Finding / Creating a color scheme"> Finding / Creating a color scheme</h3>
<p>
<!-- NEEDS A LOT OF WORK. -->
This is the foundation the rest of your design will sit upon, The color scheme you choose can easily make or break a rice, So it is vitally important to pick a good looking one and build everything around it.<br/>
<br/>
The colours must match with each other and any shade should look good with any other from the same scheme no matter exactly how its used.<br/>
<br/>
Your colour scheme can have as many colours as you desire but at minimum there must 8 colours and ideally you have 16 colours.<br/>
<br/>
These 16 are split into 2 groups, "regulars" and "brights", If you have only 8 colours then your "brights" will be the same as your "regulars"<br/>
<br/>
<div class="ovr-x"><table class="">
<thead><tr>
<th>Regular</th>
<th>Bright</th>
<th>Name</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody><tr>
<td>00</td>
<td>08</td>
<td>Black<br/></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>01</td>
<td>09</td>
<td>Red<br/></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>02</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>Green<br/></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>03</td>
<td>11</td>
<td>Yellow<br/></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>04</td>
<td>12</td>
<td>Blue<br/></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>05</td>
<td>13</td>
<td>Magenta<br/></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>06</td>
<td>14</td>
<td>Cyan<br/></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>07</td>
<td>15</td>
<td>White</td>
<td><br/></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table></div>
<br/>
It's also important that your colour scheme work well for syntax highlighting (& be semantic) and be suitable for using in GUI environments.<br/>
<br/>
For an example, Here are some ones I really like:<br/>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/savq/melange">https://github.com/savq/melange</a><br/>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sainnhe/gruvbox-material">https://github.com/sainnhe/gruvbox-material</a><br/>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rose-pine/rose-pine-theme">https://github.com/rose-pine/rose-pine-theme</a><br/>
</li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/snakedye/chocolate">https://gitlab.com/snakedye/chocolate</a><br/>
</li>
</ul><br/></p>
<h3 id="###-Wallpaper"> Wallpaper</h3>
<p>
<br/>
After some time, looking at the plain black default background gets tiring so let's set a pretty background, This may seem like a small step but the background you choose can heavily affect the colors you can use in the rest of your rice. So ideally pick something you can contrast easily and one that isn't visually busy, Your focus shouldn't be immediately attracted to wallpaper at first sight.<br/>
* You can find some good places to find wallpapers here: <a href="https://nes.is-a.dev/ricing-guide/how-to-rice-thing.html#wallpapers">https://nes.is-a.dev/ricing-guide/how-to-rice-thing.html#wallpapers</a><br/>
<br/>
Especially for minimalist window managers, it is common that they do not include wallpaper setter in which case an external application (usually <code>feh</code>) needs to be used.<br/>
<br/>
To illustrate: <br/>
<img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/635625973764849684/998503072781320282/9_-_lmDxmn6.jpg?width=776&height=485" alt="" title="" loading="lazy" /><br/>
 is an example of what I'd call a good wallpaper, it can easily with a color scheme like melange or gruvbox material and there is plenty of contrast to place any desktop widgets if I so choose, of course you have to like it too, its your desktop after all.<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<h2 id="##-Getting Comfortable"> Getting Comfortable</h2>
<p>
<br/>
So now we have the very start of a rice, We have chosen a color scheme and we have a wallpaper to go with it, From here our rice can go wherever you want it to really.<br/>
<br/>
Since we are going to be editing all our configuration files from within our text editor, We should start with ricing that and becoming comfortable in it.<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<h3 id="###-Editor"> Editor</h3>
<p>
I'm writing this with neovim in mind but I'll try to make it as general as possible.<br/>
I'll just go through the steps to make your editor to fit in your rice and some extra steps you can take for beautification.<br/>
<br/>
When using neovim with the default colors, this is what we get, Nothing much to look at is it.<br/>
<img src="../embed/editor0.png" alt="" title="" loading="lazy" /><br/>
<br/>
Let's at least start by matching colours with our chosen colour scheme, Depending on whether you made your colour scheme yourself, there will probably already exist a theme made by some poor soul to fit. This becomes less likely on other editors. If you made a base16 theme this isn't really a concern as from how base16 themes work, one can be generated from just the set of colours.<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<h4 id="####-Making a theme for VIM (VimScript)"> Making a theme for VIM (VimScript)</h4>
<p>
If such a theme doesn't exist, It isn't a big problem since Vim makes it fairly simple to create a theme.  <br/>
<b>Read</b> <code>:help highlight</code> & <code>:help colorscheme</code> & <code>:help coloring</code>  <br/>
Basically every thing with colour in vim belongs to a <i>highlight group</i> that specifies things like foreground background & text style. The styles for every highlight group can be modified with the <code>highlight</code> command from vimscript<br/>
<br/>
For an example, here is the port of the chocolate theme I made for vim:<br/>
<pre>
<code><span style="color:#898989; font-style:italic">&quot; Typescript</span>

If you spend time configuring extension appearances (Some are astoundingly bad at following default highlight groups) too it can take some time but the basic UI & syntax hl groups shouldn't take too long.<br/>
