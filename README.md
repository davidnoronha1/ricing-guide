# üçö Ricing Guide

This guide is hosted on [Github Pages](https://nes.is-a.dev/ricing-guide)

This is my own ricing guide based on my time ricing and what I see people asking for and such in the r/unixporn discord server 

## Contributing
Just create a new file in `./src` and add yourself to the credits section in `./src/index.md`
If you require any assets, you may host them externally or put them in `./embed` or `./assets`, They both serve the same purpose

If you need any help, feel free to contact me on Discord @ dark_nes., You will also more easily find in the aforemetioned discord server.

### Linking
Links from `./src/index.md` must be prefixed with `./out/` since `index.html` is not located in the `./out/` directory but everything else is,
Other links should be preferably relative instead of absolution (start with `./` or `../` instead of `/`)

# TODO
- [X] Phase out custom markdown syntax so that can be viewed from GH
