<h1>How to RTFM &amp; Get help</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE]
TLDR: Read documentation before asking questions and if you don‚Äôt find / can‚Äôt think of an answer, put effort into asking questions and ask questions in places where they are most likely to answered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Read manuals whenever you can, those can be easily accessed for any installed software by doing <code>man &lt;NAME-OF-SOFTWARE&gt;</code>, or by searching through a online <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/">repository</a>.
If manpages are too long for you, You can also try using <a href="https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr">tldr-pages</a> to get the very basics of an application with some examples</p>
<p>Applications will list all their options there along with addition options specific to the application. Many apps also have GitHub wikis or documentation in the README for their app, kindly refer to those too.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre decent at googling - you can find most things you need to relatively easily with maybe a little help. If your question is a something like <code>can X do Y</code>, that is a question that should be solved by google and the application‚Äôs documentation.</p>
<p>Dig deep into the dotfiles of other rices, if you have no idea how they did a thing. Most people are willing to explain how / why they did something in such a way, Which is a great way to learn and understand things.</p>
<h4>Do not expect a guide / tutorial</h4>
<p>I put this here because I see questions like ‚ÄúHow do I rice?‚Äù or ‚ÄúIs there a tutorial for it?‚Äù way more often than I‚Äôd like.</p>
<p>Barely any linux software is documented in such a through manner to have documentation like that.
Most of the software isn‚Äôt trying to hold your hand. Most of it is to fill a need for the developer himself and which he has kindly shared with the community. Of course this isn‚Äôt a situation that I like but it‚Äôs just difficult and annoying to document things at times but by and large most applications have a community willing to help you out with any problems that might arise</p>
<p>But I‚Äôd suggest you don‚Äôt come into ricing expecting everything to hold your hand, It‚Äôs about exploration and about expressing oneself and those things I don‚Äôt think can be taught üòÖ</p>
<p>Some knowledge of UI / UX design certainly doesn‚Äôt hurt</p>
<h4>Getting help</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>[!IMPORTANT]
Found a nice article on the topic, read it!:  http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[!IMPORTANT]
SO has a guide on how to ask questions that applies to a lot of other places, https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ask for help in a community related to that one piece of software you want help for. Usually there is at least a GitHub discussion, an IRC chat room or a Matrix space / discord server for most things.
Make good use of them, you‚Äôll meet developers of the software and actual users of the software there. Instead of asking in something like the UP server which is only mildly related to that software.</p>
<p>Be nice, and diplomatic,
All of the people helping you are volunteering and spending their time and effort to help you solve your problem. Even if their solution isn‚Äôt exactly what you wanted, it could still point out the right way to a solution.
Explore properly and don‚Äôt criticize anyone for giving an answer that did not solve your problem.</p>
<p>See the following: <a href="https://dontasktoask.com/">Don‚Äôt ask to ask.</a> &amp; <a href="https://xyproblem.info/">The X / Y Problem</a></p>
<p>Stick to the correct channels and follow rules.
If you spam your question in multiple channels, that simply draws ire from the members of the community and doesn‚Äôt increase the chances of your question being solved.
Do not think you are being ignored if your question isn‚Äôt answered in a reasonable amount of time (usually a day or 2, other people have lives too, you know).
It‚Äôs either that no one knows the solution to your problem or no one cares enough to answer it (in which case, write your question out with more effort, and try to see if it has been solved in the documentation or elsewhere already).
Write out your question in overwhelming detail - mention everything you have already tried and what you have found related to your problem.
Upload your configuration files somewhere (like <a href="https://0x0.st">0x0.st</a> or <a href="https://paste.rs">paste.rs</a>) and link them in your question, share screenshots of what your problem is.
Try explaining it in simple language.</p>
<p>And ofcourse it‚Äôs difficult to get decent help if your setup is very complicated (eg: running into an issue while using musl libc) so that‚Äôs more of a made your own bed so sleep in it situation‚Ä¶</p>
