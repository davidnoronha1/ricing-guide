<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<h4>What distribution do I use?</h4>
<p>It really does not matter for the purpose of Ricing, If you are new to Linux,
Ill recommend Ubuntu, Debian or Fedora to start with.</p>

<h4>Choosing a window manager / desktop environment</h4>
<blockquote>
there are many tools you can use to achieve what you want, i don't think it's really possible to list everything but i can give you some insights:
<ol>
<li>window managers like fvwm: (https://www.fvwm.org/) and awesome (https://awesomewm.org/) have their own widgeting system which you could use to build custom user interfaces most other desktops can’t offer, they enable you to make your own themes completely from the ground up as they don’t rely on the popular gtk or qt toolkits</li>
</ol>
<p>1.1) you could also use a standalone widgeting tool which is in development and pretty much does most of what awesome does already called eww, which you can know more about here: https://github.com/elkowar/eww</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>you could use a low resource window manager known as being customizable enough with third-party tools to build  your user interface piece by piece
example: you can mix openbox, polybar for a bar, latte dock for the bottom dock macos comes with, albert for application launcher, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you could use a low resource desktop environment that packs most of what you need but can be a little resource heavier
example: xfce is pretty well known for being extremely modular, you can both find pre-existing themes or build your own on top of it and the de will pack most of what you need right out of the box</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>if you’re not aware what 1) and 1.1) do, exactly, i recommend reading about them first or even checking our unixporn subreddit out before getting your hands into any of this – you might not even need those tools, as i don’t know what you have in mind and am just showing you the way
reminding you that you’re not, at all, tied to the software i have mentioned here
you have a world of other options you can pick from and do your own thing, it’s just that there are so many options and ways that it’s hard to summarize everything and i often need to oversimplify stuff</p>
